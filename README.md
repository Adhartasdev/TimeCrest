# TimeCrest
TimeCrest is the website of an Alternative Real Estate fund focused on Commercial Real Estate. It is made for both marketing and asset trading purposes. As all websites in the industry, it is there to show authenticity, confidence and control. 

## UX
 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of TimeCrest is to provide profitable fund management for its clients and thus to generate consistent returns on longer term basis.  It also needs to appear as a beacon of stability and authenticity to the market. As the business runs on investing, buying and selling assets on a pan-european basis, it needs to demonstrate a clear offering and field of activities. The information needs to be displayed in English and should stay relatively short and to the point. 

There are three different users of the website: 

* Investors prospecting funds to manage their capital
* Asset Buyers & Sellers
* Government Authorities

#### Investor Goals
The central target audience for TimeCrest are investors who are looking to commit capital above EUR 350.000. 

Investor goals are:

* Access necessary information fast
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund first
* Understand the focus of the fund
* Understand the deal-types realised
* Feel empowered by history and strategy


#### Asset Buyers & Sellers Goals
The secondary audience of TimeCrest are buyers and sellers willing to trade assets with TimeCrest. These are put in the same category, as they are looking for the same information. 

Asset buyers & seller goals are:

* Indentify exaclty which assets are targetted by TimeCrest
* Identify the criteria & transaction types that are being considered
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund 


#### Government Authorities Goals

The least targeted audience of TimeCrest are government authorities. As they supervise the financial markets and funds, they need to be able to see, communicate and fact-check the information displayed on TimeCrest. 

Government authorities goals are:

* To fact check true information on TimeCrest
* To collect activity information on TimeCrest
* To obtain a true number on Assets Under Management fast
* To be able to communicate with TimeCrest via its website.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

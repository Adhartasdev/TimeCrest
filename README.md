# TimeCrest
TimeCrest is the website of an Alternative Real Estate fund focused on Commercial Real Estate. It is made for both marketing and asset trading purposes. As all websites in the industry, it is there to show authenticity, confidence and control. 

## UX
 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of TimeCrest is to provide profitable fund management for its clients and thus to generate consistent returns on longer term basis.  It also needs to appear as a beacon of stability and authenticity to the market. As the business runs on investing, buying and selling assets on a pan-european basis, it needs to demonstrate a clear offering and field of activities. The information needs to be displayed in English and should stay relatively short and to the point. 

There are three different users of the website: 

* Investors prospecting funds to manage their capital
* Asset Buyers & Sellers
* Government Authorities

#### Investor Goals
The central target audience for TimeCrest are investors who are looking to commit capital above EUR 350.000. 

Investor goals are:

* Access necessary information fast
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund first
* Understand the focus of the fund
* Understand the deal-types realised
* Feel empowered by history and strategy


#### Asset Buyers & Sellers Goals
The secondary audience of TimeCrest are buyers and sellers willing to trade assets with TimeCrest. These are put in the same category, as they are looking for the same information. 

Asset buyers & seller goals are:

* Indentify exaclty which assets are targetted by TimeCrest
* Identify the criteria & transaction types that are being considered
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund 


#### Government Authorities Goals

The least targeted audience of TimeCrest are government authorities. As they supervise the financial markets and funds, they need to be able to see, communicate and fact-check the information displayed on TimeCrest. 

Government authorities goals are:

* To fact check true information on TimeCrest
* To collect activity information on TimeCrest
* To obtain a true number on Assets Under Management fast
* To be able to communicate with TimeCrest via its website.


### Developer & Business Goals

* This project will enable the developer to propose his services to diverse funds whom wish to push their efforts on the digital presentation. 
* The project should showcase deisgn capacities and the ability to understand a specific topic.
* This project should embody the statute of a real fund, with clear factual information and logical structure. 
* Often it is the case that investors look for funds they can trust, but the true Call-to-Action is done through the first contact. As you are not buying anything, but investing in a fund. There is no true action until the conversation begins and an initial investment policy is being drafted. Therefore, this website's primary goal is to demonstrate track record, entrusted services and volume. 

### User Stories

As an investor looking to allocate my capital, I want:
* to see a serious website that demonstrates trust and authenticity, so that I can consider them for allocating my capital.
* an easy navigation through the website, so that I do not have to configure each time how to access my desired information.
* to see excalty how much capital they manage and how many investors they have, so that I can feel secure and reassured.
* to understand exactly which services they offer, so that I can plan my personal strategy, should I contact them. 
* to be able to contact them quickly when I am convinced and not have to search everywhere for the contact form.

As a buyer or seller of assets, I want:
* to directly understand whether they trade in the same assets as I do, so that I can determine if I am in the right place to do business.
* the ability to reach out at every page, so that I do not have to search everywhere for the contact form.
* to know how big they are, so that I do not waste time for both parties criteria- & scope- wise. 
* to understand what type of deal they make before contacting them, so that I can determine whether or not it is of interest.
* to know which to type of assets they own, so that I can determine or not whether they are of interest.

As a government officer, I want:
* to know their fund size and check the fundamental numbers on their website, in order to determine whether their public relations are compliant or not.
* to be able to communicate directly with TimeCrest, no matter which page I am on.  

### Design Choices
The general design choices have been made around simplicity, authenticity and trust. In finance, it is important to stay on the simple edge of design. However, that is what makes it tricky, the colours red, orange, yellow and even balck are not often used as overarching colours. It is important to stay on the light and blue and of the spectrum. The same goes with font-type, this project has aimed to differentiate itself from the competition by employing less serif oriented fonts and go with a more round variety. 

#### Fonts

* The primary font is Montserrat due to its easy going round aspect. It is an easy-read, round, class and nice to read letter type. At the same time, it is also distinguising the website in regards to its market competition, in that they use more Serif oriented and square fonts.
* The second font is Roboto, the latter is not used much throughout the project, but goes well with Montserrat. It will enable to highlight certain items and keep the same round aspect. The project is there to inspire trust and innovation, thus the design has a great role to play in it. By this is meant, the more classy and round the fonts, the better feeling it gives to the user. 

#### Icons
* All Icons in this project have been associated with their obvious meaning. Given that it is a money-driven Real Estate Fund, it focusses broadly on icons that encompass the underlying assets mentioned. No specific Icon with unique meaning has been used.

#### Colours

The general website's colors are white and blue. Bellow some specifics:
* Button colours: #1378f5
* Footer Colour: #162438
* Text: black
* Backgrounds (non-image): white

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

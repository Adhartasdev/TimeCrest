# TimeCrest
TimeCrest is the website of an Alternative Real Estate fund focused on Commercial Real Estate. It is made for both marketing and asset trading purposes. As all websites in the industry, it is there to show authenticity, confidence and control. 

## UX
 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of TimeCrest is to provide profitable fund management for its clients and thus to generate consistent returns on longer term basis.  It also needs to appear as a beacon of stability and authenticity to the market. As the business runs on investing, buying and selling assets on a pan-european basis, it needs to demonstrate a clear offering and field of activities. The information needs to be displayed in English and should stay relatively short and to the point. 

There are three different users of the website: 

* Investors prospecting funds to manage their capital
* Asset Buyers & Sellers
* Government Authorities

#### Investor Goals
The central target audience for TimeCrest are investors who are looking to commit capital above EUR 350.000. 

Investor goals are:

* Access necessary information fast
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund first
* Understand the focus of the fund
* Understand the deal-types realised
* Feel empowered by history and strategy


#### Asset Buyers & Sellers Goals
The secondary audience of TimeCrest are buyers and sellers willing to trade assets with TimeCrest. These are put in the same category, as they are looking for the same information. 

Asset buyers & seller goals are:

* Indentify exaclty which assets are targetted by TimeCrest
* Identify the criteria & transaction types that are being considered
* Ability to contact on every page 
* See important data on fund 


#### Government Authorities Goals

The least targeted audience of TimeCrest are government authorities. As they supervise the financial markets and funds, they need to be able to see, communicate and fact-check the information displayed on TimeCrest. 

Government authorities goals are:

* To fact check true information on TimeCrest
* To collect activity information on TimeCrest
* To obtain a true number on Assets Under Management fast
* To be able to communicate with TimeCrest via its website.


### Developer & Business Goals

* This project will enable the developer to propose his services to diverse funds whom wish to push their efforts on the digital presentation. 
* The project should showcase deisgn capacities and the ability to understand a specific topic.
* This project should embody the statute of a real fund, with clear factual information and logical structure. 
* Often it is the case that investors look for funds they can trust, but the true Call-to-Action is done through the first contact. As you are not buying anything, but investing in a fund. There is no true action until the conversation begins and an initial investment policy is being drafted. Therefore, this website's primary goal is to demonstrate track record, entrusted services and volume. 

### User Stories

### Design Choices
The general design choices have been made around simplicity, authenticity and trust. In finance, it is important to stay on the simple edge of design. However, that is what makes it tricky, the colours red, orange, yellow and even balck are not often used as overarching colours. It is important to stay on the light and blue and of the spectrum. The same goes with font-type, this project has aimed to differentiate itself from the competition by employing less serif oriented fonts and go with a more round variety. 

#### Fonts

* The primary font is Montserrat due to its easy going round aspect. It is an easy-read, round, class and nice to read letter type. At the same time, it is also distinguising the website in regards to its market competition, in that they use more Serif oriented and square fonts.
* The second font is Roboto, the latter is not used much throughout the project, but goes well with Montserrat. It will enable to highlight certain items and keep the same round aspect. The project is there to inspire trust and innovation, thus the design has a great role to play in it. By this is meant, the more classy and round the fonts, the better feeling it gives to the user. 

#### Icons
* All Icons in this project have been associated with their obvious meaning. Given that it is a money-driven Real Estate Fund, it focusses broadly on icons that encompass the underlying assets mentioned. No specific Icon with unique meaning has been used.

#### Colours

The general website's colors are white and blue. Bellow some specifics:
* Button colours: #1378f5
* Footer Colour: #162438
* Text: black
* Backgrounds (non-image): white

### Specific Test User UX response:

* **Hotel management expert, female, aged 24**:
She stated that as a real estate professional she perfectly understood the range of services that the site offered and that it was logical to her to both navigate and understand the different pages on the website. In addition, she stated that the contact form should not be placed on each website, just as the Developer’s mentor. So that was corrected. 

* **Financial management and Real Estate student, male, aged 19**:
He stated that the website was clear and intuitive in its details. He suggested that further developments, including a portfolio would be a plus. However, the purpose of the website is clearly demonstrated and inspires confidence in the business at hand.
